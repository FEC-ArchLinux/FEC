# Usage

# Installation and Setup
## Here are some scripts to get started
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run client-dev` runs webpack to watches for changes to files in FEC/client/src, transpiles them from jsx to js using babel, then bundles them into FEC/client/public
- `npm run server-dev` runs nodemon to restart the node application after any changes
- `npm run start` runs a development server with live reload capability for development purposes only


# Testing

`npm run test` currently does nothing
